by historical standards, but he might perceive himself to be poor
compared to members of the bourgeoisie, whom he sees regularly
buying luxury goods that he is not able to afford.
Terms from the Arts, Sciences, and Social Sciences

pares the universe to a mechanical clock created by God. Accord-
ing to this theory, once created, the universe continues to run
according to the laws of nature and does not require further Divine
intervention. This idea was very popular in the Enlightenment, an
eighteenth-century philosophical movement that emphasized the
use of reason to examine accepted beliefs and traditions.

superior at surviving and reproducing.
39ESSENTIAL WORDS FOR THE GRE

called Bacchanalia—wild orgies of frenzied revelry, drunkenness,
and debauchery.
The noun anarchism refers to the theory that all forms of government
are oppressive and should be abolished. It also means the advocacy of
this theory or the attempt to bring about anarchism.

Explanation: The independent clause after the colon describes
photographs of Earth from space. This signals that the best choice for
Blank (ii) is cosmic (relating to the universe as distinct from Earth). An
important clue to Blank (iii) is “such a beautiful and intricately inter-

answer to Blank (i) can now be selected. The sentence says that pho-
tographs of Earth from space may have encouraged people to “reflect
on the folly of disrupting such a beautiful and intricately interrelated
biosphere” of Earth, so it makes sense that the Apollo missions had a
part in crystallizing support for the environmental movement.

Terms from the Arts, Sciences, and Social Sciences
In folklore the halcyon (kingfisher) is a bird that brings peace and
calm to the ocean waves for several days around the time of winter
solstice, when it builds its nest on the sea and lays its eggs there.
The expressions halcyon days and halcyon years describes periods
of time that are tranquil and happy.
The origins of the halcyon myth can be traced back to ancient
Greece and the story of the queen Alcyone (Halcyone) who threw
herself into the sea when she saw the dead body of her husband
Ceyx, the King of Thessaly, who had drowned in a shipwreck.
Pitying Alcyone, the gods transformed both her and Ceyx into
kingfishers (halcyon), and they remained in the sea where they
mated and had young. While Alcyone laid her eggs and brooded
over the nest on the sea, Aeolus, keeper of the sea winds,
restrained these winds so that the ocean surface would remain
calm and peaceful.

and other (i) ______ drugs has allowed treatment of conditions that
in the past were (ii) ________ to therapy.
Blank (i) Blank (ii)
hermetic precursors
ineffective impervious
psychotropic analogous
Explanation: Psychotropic (having an altering effect on perception or
behavior) is the correct choice because the three types of drugs men-
tioned all affect perception or behavior. If you didn’t know the mean-
ing of psychotropic, you could still arrive at the correct answer if you
knew the meaning of hermetic and ineffective, which don’t make sense
in context. Also, the word “psychotropic” contains the Greek root psych
(mind), showing that the word has something to do with the mind.
161ESSENTIAL WORDS FOR THE GRE
Clues to the answer to Blank (ii) are the words “development” and
“past.” These words tell us that drugs developed recently have made
possible treatment of conditions that in the past were impervious (inca-

The correct answers are psychotropic and impervious.

society: that bastion of individualism produces a profusion of pub-
lic institutions requiring (ii) ___________ to create.
Blank (i) Blank (ii)
conundrum tremendous ingenuity
weakness a great collective effort
paradox admirable altruism
Explanation: The clue to the answer for Blank (ii) is “public institu-
tions.” It makes sense that public institutions require a great collective
effort to create. Knowing the answer to Blank (ii) allows us to select the
answer for Blank (i) because “collective effort” and “individualism” are
antithetical. The paradox (contradiction, incongruity) is that a society
that values individualism produces many institutions requiring groups
of people to work together.
The correct answers are paradox and a great collective effort.

 abor unions sometimes (i) __________ the use of confrontational
tactics and (ii) __________ in negotiation as necessitated by the
entrenched power of big business.
Blank (i) Blank (ii)
justify compliance
abjure intransigence
criticize submissiveness
Explanation: An important clue to the answer to this question is the
phrase “confrontational tactics,” which signals that extreme methods
are being discussed. The phrase “as necessitated” signals that labor
unions sometimes see such tactics as necessary, so it makes sense that
they would justify (demonstrate to be right) such tactics. Because the
word for Blank (ii) is paired with the words “confrontational tactics,” it
should have a similar meaning, so intransigence (being uncompromis-
ing) is the correct answer.
The correct answers are justify and intransigence.

color tones.
Blank (i) Blank (ii)
at all militated against
inadvertently added to
as it actually is sanctioned
Explanation: The words “but as it ‘impresses’ the painter” signal that
the correct answer for Blank (i) is as it actually is.
Blank (ii): What is said about Manet in the sentence after the semi-
colon is positive, so what is said about Manet before the semicolon
must be negative because of the word “but.” Militated against (exerted
influence against) is the correct answer because this creates a negative
statement about Manet.
The correct answers are as it actually is and militated against.

Explanation: The statement in quotes about the cause of war is
described as “sweeping” (too inclusive), so the best choice for Blank (i)
is qualified (limited).
The second statement in quotes is more believable than the first
statement because it has been qualified. Thus, the best choice for

252  ESSENTIAL WORDS FOR THE GRE
Blank (i) Blank (ii)
capriciousness no matter how recondite
dilemma however unscientific
aesthetic consideration although empirically-based
Explanation: An important clue to the answers to this question is
the phrase “laws that... are fully testable and verifiable,” which tells
what kind of laws of nature Einstein preferred. Capriciousness (being
subject to sudden change) is the best choice for Blank (i) because
this quality would make laws of nature difficult to test and verify.
Another clue to this answer is the word “troubling;” Einstein found
this capriciousness of nature troubling.
The answer to Blank (ii) can be found by elimination of however
unscientific and although empirically-based, which make no sense in
context. No matter how recondite is a good choice because it makes
sense that it would not matter if laws of nature were recondite
(abstruse) as long as they could be tested and verified.
The correct answers are capriciousness and no matter how
recondite.

stratified adj. arranged in layers
One of the implications of an increasingly stratified economy for
America might be increased social unrest.
The noun stratum means a layer.
In the English-speaking world many members of the upper classes
historically have had a deprecatory attitude toward slang, a form of
language they regard as indecorous and thus suitable only for the
lowest stratum of society.
The plural of stratum is strata.
As it matured as a science, geology began to complement biology,
a process that helped it to gain a more comprehensive view of the
history of life on Earth by allowing fossils to be dated and identified
(paleontology), often using knowledge gained from stratigraphy—the
study of the deposition, distribution, and age of rock strata.
The noun stratification is used in the sociological term social strati-
fication. It refers to the hierarchical arrangement of individuals in a
society into classes or castes.
